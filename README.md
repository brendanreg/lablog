This repository is where I keep all documentation of my activities involving my home lab and HTB adventures. Started May 2025.
You can find my timesheet, where I document my activities on a high level, at lablog/timesheet. You can also find write ups about my passion projects and HTB sherlocks within.
Thank you,
