sun     5/18/25    7:15pm     11:00pm    3.75    spun up a pfsense ce vm, 
                                                 configured it to use hyper-v

                                                 decide on Suricata due to pfsense and 
                                                 splunk support, install suricata package 
                                                 on pfsense, begin configuring suricata        
                                                 on wan interface

tues    5/20/25    5:15pm      5:43pm    0.50    enable suricata on wan interface, discover 
                                                 and troubleshoot immediate connectivity issues 
                                                 due to ids blocking everything lol

                                                 responder on kali, spin up new kali vm & install 
                                                 desktop environment, read a few resources on llmnr 
                                                 responder attacks, spin up w11 pro machine to act as 
                                                 victim, read official responder docs from kali. 
                                                 simultaneously begin working on noxious sherlock from
                                                 htb and complete it, intent on working on lab tomorrow.
