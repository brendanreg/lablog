sun     5/18/25    7:15pm     11:00pm    3.75    spun up a pfsense ce vm, 
                                                 configured it to use hyper-v  
                                                 external switch for wan interface and 
                                                 internal switch for lan interface, 
                                                 configured dhcp & ssh + enable remote 
                                                 syslog server, spun up a windows server 
                                                 2022 vm and promoted to ad domain 
                                                 controller, installed splunk enterprise, 
                                                 configured local event viewer data inputs, 
                                                 created new udp data input and leveraged 
                                                 TA-pfSense splunk add-on in conjunction 
                                                 with CIM to receive logs & read fields 
                                                 from pfSense

mon     5/19/25    11:10pm     11:35pm   0.50    Read about open source IDS solutions, 
                                                 decide on Suricata due to pfsense and 
                                                 splunk support, install suricata package 
                                                 on pfsense, begin configuring suricata        
                                                 on wan interface

tues    5/20/25    5:15pm      5:43pm    0.50    enable suricata on wan interface, discover 
                                                 and troubleshoot immediate connectivity issues 
                                                 due to ids blocking everything lol

                                                 rules, etc. and enable on lan interface so as not to

sat     5/24/25    11:45am    3:40pm     4.00    intent on simulating an llmnr poisoning attack using 
                                                 responder on kali, spin up new kali vm & install 
                                                 desktop environment, read a few resources on llmnr 
                                                 responder attacks, spin up w11 pro machine to act as 
                                                 victim, read official responder docs from kali. 
                                                 simultaneously begin working on noxious sherlock from
                                                 htb and complete it along with write up on solution, 
                                                 intent on working on llmnr simulation tomorrow.

sat     5/24/25    6:30pm     8:00pm     1.50    finish setting the stage for llmnr poisoning 
                                                 simulation; join w11 victim machine to domain, 
                                                 create fileshare on dc & verify ability to reach 
                                                 it via victim machine, switch private switch to 
                                                 internal to allow host os to peer inside and capture 
                                                 traffic with wireshark, simulate llmnr poison attack 
                                                 with responder and analyze traffic with wireshark +
